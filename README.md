# Code Kata Groovy

Need to learn some Groovy? Take a look at [Groovy Koans](http://nadavc.github.io/groovykoans/)!

# Why Groovy

Groovy is commonly used as the DSL for gradle build files, so most Java developers and many
developers on other projects will need to have some familiarity with this language and it's
a little different to most C-esque languages.
